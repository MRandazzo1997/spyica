# SpyICA

Investigate the applicability of ICA for spike sorting and how it compares to other state-of-the-art spike sorters.

### Run and evaluate spike sorting

To run a spike sorting approach on a specified dataset run (in ipython):

`run spike_sorting -r path-to-rec-folder -mod spike-sorting-algorithm`

Both data generated by the `generate_recordings.py` and by ViSAPy are supported. For ViSAPy the folder name must start with `savedata` and it should contain `ViSAPy_filterstep_1.h5` and `ViSAPy_ground_truth.gdf` files.

The supported spike-sorting algorithms (so far) are:

- ICA - instantaneous ICA + skewness/correlation-based pruning

- cICA - convolutive ICA + skewness/correlation-based pruning (use parameter -L to set the FIR length)

- (smooth)  smoothed ICA implemented in Tensorflow

- (spykingcircus) to be implemented...
